# **Time Series Analysis Using SMA EMA RNN**

## **Description**

In This project I will demonstrate how to use 
Machine Learning Algorithms -Recurrent Neural Networks 
[using Tensorflow KERAS] - to do time series analysis, in partucilar:
Bitcoin Price Prediction.

## **Getting Started**

Simply clone the repository and run the .ipynb file in jupyter
notebook, Goodgle Colabotary, or any other text editor that 
supports the iPython Notebook. And Just click the 'Restart & Run All'
option and the file will run itself...

## **Results**
This model did exceptionally well. It achieved the following results:

	Train Score: 4.75 RMSE
	Test Score: 5.96 RMSE
	
Please note that this demonstration was for educational purposes only
and not a proposal of a get rich quick scheme. As more complex code
needs to be added to guarantee the security of one's capital: such
as decryption of blocks in a blockchain to verify the true value of the
bitcoin-block and more risk-management logics that are known to the 
professionals in the financial-markets industry.
